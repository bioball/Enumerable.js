Enumerable.js
-------------

*enumerating utility functions to empower your .each*

This is a port of Ruby's Enumerable module into JavaScript. Simply define what `.each` means for your class, and you gain access to a wealth of functions, including reduce, filter, eachSlice, etc.

This is currently a work in progress.
